Balerion
========

"because crawlers are awesome"

##Balerion is a very basic crawler that does the following stuff.

1. Take a given input url and fetch all the links on that page into a repository of links.
2. Take a random url from existing repository and repeat step 1 recursively.
3. Stop when all the links have been fetched / previously set limit of max fetch is reached.

## Identifying links in page content
Balerion uses simple XPATH to identify the links.
